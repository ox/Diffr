PaperCreate
====================

Paper crate is a versioned 
file store service. It
leverages many technologies
like S3, Sinatra, Rack and 
Diff::LCS amongst others.

Usage:

send a file:
curl -F "file=@file.txt" papercrate.heroku.com

this will automagically
version the file if there
are any changes.

get a files' version:
curl papercrate.heroku.com/what/version/file.txt

send back as a json like:
{"version":3}

get latest version of a file:
curl papercrate.heroku.com/clone/file.txt

get certain version of file(wip):
curl papercrate.heroku.com/get/v4/file.txt

for these last two
functions, you actually 
get a json back like:
{"name":"file.txt","version":"1","text":"some file3\n"}
